    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      This project had almost the same requirements as Project 1. Each user
      needed a login where if someone did not have an account, a signup
      mechanism was implemented. Each user could add, search for, edit, and
      delete their own contacts. The initial page was a log in or sign up page.
      The main difference with this project is that the group had a choice to
      make whatever website they wanted.

    <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The skills I leanred from the project was once again building on my
      understanding of remote databases, how to use a LAMP stack, JSON, and API
      endpoints. My skills on the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were
      strengthened even more. This project did test my creativty and
      communication within a group more than the first project.
