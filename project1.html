      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        This project is described on the assignment page as a personal contact
        manager. Each user needed a login where if someone did not have an
        account, a signup mechanism was implemented. Each user could add, search
        for, edit, and delete their own contacts. The initial page was a log in
        or sign up page.

      <p>
        The skills I leanred from the project was a very basic understanding of
        remote databases, how to use a LAMP stack, JSON, and API endpoints. My
        biggest contribution was strengthing my skills on the front end using
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
